      <description>


&lt;p&gt;For those just learning statistics, or who have had only a little training in the subject, this question comes up fairly often. And there is some conflicting information and advice out there. Most often I’ve seen comments critical of one-sided methods, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is: Never use one tailed tests.
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/one-tailed-and-two-tailed-tests/&#34;&gt;The Analysis Factor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-Tailed Tests are the Default Choice
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/use-one-tailed-tests/&#34;&gt;Statistics by Jim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I did come across at least one person I’ve seen suggests the opposite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually intend to go all the way and argue that barring some very narrow use-cases, one should never use a two-tailed statistical test.
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.analytics-toolkit.com/2017/one-tailed-two-tailed-tests-significance-ab-testing/&#34;&gt;Analytics Toolkit blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with all of these statements to varying degrees, though mostly the first and the third. In this post, I’ll try to clarify how to think about this so that you can know whether to use a 1-sided or 2-sided test (spoiler: It has &lt;del&gt;nothing&lt;/del&gt; little to do with Statistics). As an aside, “1-tailed” and “2-sided” are interchangable terms, and for the 1-tailed methods, there can be upper-tail or lower-tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;crash-course-on-hypothesis-testing&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crash course on hypothesis testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding 1- or 2-tailed methods is probably easiest to describe in terms of hypothesis testing, but the same concepts apply to interval estimation (instead of, e.g., a confidence interval, you can construct a 1-sided confidence bound). So to start off, I’ll give a very short summary of basic hypothesis testing. I’m going to focus on a 1-sample t-test, but the same ideas will apply to any situation where you can have two tails. If you already understand t-tests, you probably want to skip to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Define your null and alternative hypotheses. Here are two such sets, for an upper-tail and two-tailed test, respectively, on the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upper tailed: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(H_{o}: \mu \leq \mu_{0}\)&lt;/span&gt; vs &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(H_{a}: \mu &amp;gt; \mu_{0}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two tailed: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(H_{o}: \mu = \mu_{0}\)&lt;/span&gt; vs &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(H_{a}: \mu \ne \mu_{0}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu_{0}\)&lt;/span&gt; is some hypothesized value, some value we are interested in comparing against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Select a significance level, denoted by &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is the probability of committing a Type I error. This is the event in which we reject the null hypothesis when we should not have, because the null hypothesis is actually true. Any probability can be selected here, some common values are 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01. In practice we will not know whether or not a commit a Type I error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; From the data, compute the test statistic which (under certain assumptions) will follow a particular sampling distribution. One of the most basic examples is the t-test, where the test statistic is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t = (\bar{x} - \mu_{0}) / (s / \sqrt{n} )\)&lt;/span&gt; will follow a t-distribution (assuming the conditions are satisfied).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; We then put this test statistic on the t-distribution and see if it falls into the rejection region (RR). This RR is determined from the significance level, depending on how the alternative hypothesis is specified. For an upper-tail test, all of the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; probability is piled into the upper tail. For a two-tailed test, the α probability is split between the two tails. I made a graphic to illustrate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post-stats/2020-10-10-one-or-two-tails.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each figure, the shaded region represents 5% of the total area. But we have arranged that 5% differently, because the tests are answering different questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. From that decision, you’d then take appropriate action - or not. I’ll provide a couple examples further on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re more familiar with p-values or critical values, do not fear. There’s a 1-1 correspondence between these. The RR is bounded by the &lt;em&gt;critical value&lt;/em&gt;, which is the value at which the tail probability is equal to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt;. Hence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the test statistic is in the rejection region (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t \in RR\)&lt;/span&gt;), then &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p \leq \alpha\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-choose-1-or-2-tails&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to choose 1 or 2 tails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that was a very quick overview of hypothesis testing. Then we come to the question of whether we should use a 1-tailed or 2-tailed method. To understand this, we need to understand what we’re actually doing when testing a hypothesis. Usually, we arrange the hypotheses so that the alternative hypothesis represents an actionable event, and the null hypothesis is the “status quo.” This means that when we reject the null hypothesis, we’re going to do something. I read and comment on the subreddits &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Statistics&#34;&gt;r/statistics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics&#34;&gt;r/AskStatistics&lt;/a&gt; (among others). There, I think a user with the handle &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Sodomeister&#34;&gt;The_Sodomister&lt;/a&gt; phrased it well: Rejecting the null hypothesis means we “take action.” On the other hand, failing to reject the null hypothesis means we do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to consider the context of the data, and whether we care about the direction. Let’s consider a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airlines regularly overbook flights (sell more tickets than they have seats). But for various reasons, not everyone shows up for their flight, so it often balances out. What they really care about is how many people show up, since too many people showing up means they have to pay out to reimburse anyone who can’t board that flight. So if they find that too many people will show up, they’ll take action by overbooking to a smaller degree. However, if too few people show up, well, those people paid for their ticket anyway, so the airline isn’t really losing out (that being said, they could be interested in the lower bound, so that they can overbook even further!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug as an alternative to an existing drug. They’re doing the science to try to improve upon the existing drug, so they’d like to see improved outcomes. But it is extremely important to know if the new treatment actually leads to &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; outcomes. So even though the company wants to show an effect in a particular direction, they also need to be able to detect if the effect is in the opposite direction. So the company will take action in either case (push the drug to market, or end R&amp;amp;D on the drug). So a two-tailed test would be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An engineer is designing a critical component for a rocket to send astronauts into space. That component has some failure rate, and a failure would mean the loss of millions or billions of dollars, and possibly lead to the death of the astronauts.
Since this component was carefully designed and manufactured, the plan is to use it unless the error rate is too high. So the engineer is really only interested in the upper tail, how larger might the failure rate be, rather than how low it might be; they essentially treat the upper bound as “It’s possible for the error rate to be as large as X%, so we’re going to assume it is X%.” The question then fundamentally becomes “Is X% too high?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual is considering whether to buy more of a particular stock, so they look at the average daily returns. They are interested if the daily return is positive, since they would then like to buy more. However, if the daily return is negative, that probably would lead to an action as well (say, selling that stock). Hence, detecting an effect in both directions is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct a 1-tailed test, the opposite tail needs to be of utterly no concern. In the stock example, we would have to &lt;em&gt;not care at all&lt;/em&gt; if the stock’s price was negative. There’s a good chance that’s not the case. That said, I’m no economist. Maybe for a prospective investor who doesn’t own any stock yet, their default position would be “Don’t invest,” so they really don’t care if the returns are negative, they’re only going to take action if the returns are positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s important is specifying up-front what question we are interested in answering, and what results would cause us to take action. These should be clarified before data is collected. The statistical hypotheses and direction of the method are consequences of the answers. So as I hinted at before: This isn’t really really part of the statistical method, it’s part of the research hypothesis. This means it’s a &lt;em&gt;subject-matter&lt;/em&gt; issue more than it is a &lt;em&gt;statistical&lt;/em&gt; issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we only take action for a particular direction, then we should only be testing in that direction. If we would take action for both directions, then we should test in both directions. The statistical part of this is, in my opinion, simply translating the question of interest from English (or whatever your language of choice might be) into statistical terms, such as be proposing a statistical model and rephrasing the question in terms of statistical parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess my take-away or tl;dr for this would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only care about (or would only take action) for results in a particular direction, then only test in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;trailing-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trailing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few comments I want to make that I didn’t find a good place to work into the above discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the quotes that I started off with said that two-tailed tests should be the default. The reason I disagree with this is that I don’t think there should be a “default” and an “exception.” I think we should carefully assess the context, but not be predisposed to one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole discussion only applies to a subset of statistical methods. Some methods, such as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are inherently 2-tailed. However, there are some directional variants, broadly described as tests for &lt;em&gt;ordered alternatives&lt;/em&gt;, which put a series of inequalities (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\leq\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\geq\)&lt;/span&gt;) into the alternative hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An old and reasonably well-known one is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonckheere%27s_trend_test&#34;&gt;Jonckheere–Terpstra test&lt;/a&gt;, which modifies a nonparametric ANOVA for the case of ordered alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some shameless self-promotion, some of my research has been on the subject of ordered alternatives. See for example the papers on which I am co- or lead-author,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jelsema.github.io/publication/2018-osin/&#34;&gt;Davidov, Jelsema, &amp;amp; Peddada (2018)&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jelsema.github.io/publication/2016-clme/&#34;&gt;Jelsema &amp;amp; Peddada (2016)&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a doctoral student I worked with at WVU used these methods in two applied papers,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jelsema.github.io/publication/2017-test-fire1/&#34;&gt;Law, Morris, &amp;amp; Jelsema (2017)&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jelsema.github.io/publication/2018-test-fire2/&#34;&gt;Law, Morris, &amp;amp; Jelsema (2018)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Looping PowerPoint Slides in RMarkdown </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../img/looping-pp-slides.png&#34; alt=&#34;title-image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you are fairly familiar with RMarkdown. If not, you may want to start with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/&#34;&gt;RMarkdown: The Definitive Guide&lt;/a&gt;, or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. The short version is that RMarkdown is a flavor of the markup language
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, which uses plain-text formatting and can be rendered
into a variety of output types, including PDF, MS Word, HTML, and others. With RMarkdown, you can incorporate R
&amp;ldquo;code chunks&amp;rdquo; to create a fully reproducible document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With RMarkdown, you can also create a PowerPoint presentation, meaning that you can create a reproducible slide
deck which includes code and results. You might ask why use PowerPoint when there are a variety of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html&#34;&gt;presentation formats&lt;/a&gt; that RMarkdown supports. I personally
like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html&#34;&gt;xaringan &lt;/a&gt; format. However, sometimes your hands are tied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re doing an analysis for someone who insists on PP (maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll just take a couple of your slides to incorporate into a larger presentation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe you have a corporate PP template that you have to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the technology that the presentation will be projected on doesn&amp;rsquo;t support HTML slides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for whatever the reason, you need to make do with PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complication: Suppose you need to do the same basic analysis for a number of variables.
For example, say you need to generate a set of boxplots, and a table of summary statistics for each variable in Fisher&amp;rsquo;s Iris data,
comparing across the three Species.
You&amp;rsquo;re already using RMarkdown, because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be running results in R and then pasting figures and tables over to the slide deck manually.
But you also don&amp;rsquo;t really want to be copy-pasting the same code all over, right? (Hint: No, you don&amp;rsquo;t).
So we&amp;rsquo;d like to automate this process. You should be familiar with writing loops in R, and with that and a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/child-document.html&#34;&gt;child document&lt;/a&gt; we can do exactly this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll need two files for this task, I&amp;rsquo;m going to name them &lt;strong&gt;main_doc.Rmd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;child_doc.Rmd&lt;/strong&gt;.
The next sections will walk through the code that will go into each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-document&#34;&gt;Main Document&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the main document will need a YAML header, child documents can do without (come to think of it, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they are &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to have YAML headers).
A basic one might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;Looping for PP Slides&amp;quot;
subtitle: &amp;quot;Presentation subtitle&amp;quot;
author: &amp;quot;Casey Jelsema&amp;quot;
date: &amp;quot;Generated | `r format(Sys.Date(), &#39;%B %d, %Y&#39;)`&amp;quot;
output:
  powerpoint_presentation: default
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though note that I included one minorly fancy thing here, by setting the date to be a bit of R code so that it automatically updates when the file is knit.
You may or may not want that. You can also put it elsewhere, for example in document type reports, I often set the subtitle to be the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For PP presentations, the section header (#) is what tells the document to start a new slide. You can change this with a setting in the YAML header.
For instance, maybe you will have several sections, so you want two pound signs to denote the start of a new slide, you&amp;rsquo;d add &lt;code&gt;slide_level: 2&lt;/code&gt; to the
output section, nested underneath &lt;code&gt;powerpoint_presentation&lt;/code&gt;, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html#slide-level&#34;&gt;slide level&lt;/a&gt;).
There are also a variety of other options available, including setting a reference document for a custom template, or having a two-column slide.
Both of those are described &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/powerpoint-presentation.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the main document is below. I&amp;rsquo;ll just past it all and then talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r, setup, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE }
knitr::opts_chunk$set( echo=FALSE, message=FALSE)
library(&amp;quot;tidyverse&amp;quot;)
library(&amp;quot;flextable&amp;quot;)
```

# Introduction

In this presentation we use Fisher&#39;s iris data as an example.

```{r, load-data, results=&amp;quot;hide&amp;quot; }
data(iris)
iris &amp;lt;- iris %&amp;gt;% mutate( Species = str_to_sentence(Species) )
```

- There is a code chunk here where I&#39;m loading the data and doing some formatting to clean it up.
- For the demonstration I&#39;m just going to loop through to make some box plots and a table for each of the variables.

```{r, loop-over-params, results=&amp;quot;hide&amp;quot; }
param_vec &amp;lt;- colnames(iris)[1:4]
nParam    &amp;lt;- length(param_vec)
out &amp;lt;- rep(NA,nParam)
for( ii in 1:nParam ){
  param_ii &amp;lt;- param_vec[ii]
  param_ii_nice &amp;lt;- str_replace( param_vec[ii], &amp;quot;\\.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; &amp;quot;)
  out[ii] &amp;lt;- knitr::knit_child(&amp;quot;child_doc.Rmd&amp;quot;)
}
```

```{r, print-slides, results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;}
cat( paste(out, collapse=&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;) )
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; chunk, is, well, your setup chunk. I usually use that to load which packages I&amp;rsquo;ll
be using, setting options, sometimes specifying little helper functions I use, setting up a theme for
&lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;s or creating linetypes for &lt;code&gt;flextable&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt; chunk here is a pretty basic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the section header &lt;code&gt;# Introduction&lt;/code&gt; gives us a first slide (well, beyond the title slide) with some comments.
Note that the code chunk if there, between the first line and the two bullet points, but we don&amp;rsquo;t see it.
If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with RMarkdown, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chunk, &lt;code&gt;loop-over-params&lt;/code&gt; is where the action is. So what am I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the variables to loop over, and get the number of them. Here I was easily able to extract them from the data. You might need to do a bit more work for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; object is setting up a container for me to put the slides for each variable, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;growing&amp;rdquo; the object throughout my loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then in the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loop, I&amp;rsquo;m grabbing the variable name, creating a nicer version of it for printing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I run the child document with the command &lt;code&gt;knitr::knit_child(&amp;quot;child_doc.Rmd&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works because I wrote the child document with a generic &lt;code&gt;param_ii&lt;/code&gt;, so as that object gets modified,
the child document uses different variables. The results get put into the &lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt;th space of the &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last chunk here will print the results of the looping so that they are incorporated into
the document. You need to use the &lt;code&gt;results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; option, and collapse all of the results together with
a newline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;child-document&#34;&gt;Child Document&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic version of the child document is here. One thing I want to draw your attention to is that none
of these chunks are labeled. That&amp;rsquo;s because if they get run multiple times, RMarkdown will (appropriately!)
complain that there are chunks with the same name. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to dynamically name the chunks yet.
An quick search showed that I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37703326/rmarkdown-chunk-name-from-variable&#34;&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt;
in this, and there were some solutions proposed. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried them, and have not had a need to really try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r, results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;}
# figure-slide-title
cat(&amp;quot;# Response: &amp;quot;, param_ii_nice, &amp;quot; | Box plots&amp;quot; )
```

```{r, fig.height=3.5 }
# figure-slide
ggplot( iris , aes_string(x=&amp;quot;Species&amp;quot;, y=param_ii) ) +
  geom_boxplot( aes(fill=Species) ) +
  labs( y=param_ii_nice )
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chunk is setting the title of the slide, using the &amp;ldquo;nice&amp;rdquo; version of the parameter name.
Again, I&amp;rsquo;m printing with the chunk option &lt;code&gt;results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, because we want to paste &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what
we write into the Rmd. After that, I&amp;rsquo;m just making the figure. One bit you may not be familiar with
is the &lt;code&gt;aes_string&lt;/code&gt; command in &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. Note that typically variable names are unquoted in &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;.
If you have a quoted string, then &lt;code&gt;aes_string&lt;/code&gt; will help you out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r, results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;}
# table-slide-title
cat(&amp;quot;# Response: &amp;quot;, param_ii_nice, &amp;quot; | Statistics&amp;quot; )
```

- Comments you want to make in the child slide need to use some conditional logic.
- Otherwise the same comments go on every child slide.
- That means they should probably be rather basic, if this is supposed to be automated.

```{r, ft.left=1, ft.top=6 }
# table-slide
iris %&amp;gt;%
  group_by( Species ) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(
    Mean = round( mean( get(param_ii) ), 2 ),
    SD   = round( sd( get(param_ii) ), 3 ),
    N    = n()
  ) %&amp;gt;%
  flextable() %&amp;gt;% theme_zebra() %&amp;gt;% autofit()
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;rsquo;m first defining the slide title with a &lt;code&gt;results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; chunk option, then making the
content of the slide. I tend to use the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/articles/overview.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;flextable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package for tables,
though some parts of &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;officer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; help to do some fine-tuning.
There are other table-making packages, but these have been more than enough for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly why I switched from using the &lt;code&gt;kable&lt;/code&gt; function to &lt;code&gt;flextable&lt;/code&gt;, I think that
I was having a difficult time with MS Word tables. Maybe I just didn&amp;rsquo;t put in enough effort. Regardless,
&lt;code&gt;flextable&lt;/code&gt; has been easy for me to make tables in the formats I&amp;rsquo;ve needed, and the author is actively,
improving it, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a reason to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;table-slide&lt;/code&gt; chunk, note that there are chunk options &lt;code&gt;ft.left=1, ft.top=4&lt;/code&gt;. These
define where the top-left of the table will be placed. It helps to arrange the content and
the output on a slide. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they work with tables generated from other packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;rsquo;ve copied these code chunks into &lt;strong&gt;main_doc.Rmd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;child_doc.Rmd&lt;/strong&gt; (well, you can
call the first one whatever you like, but the code references &lt;code&gt;child_doc.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;), then you should be
able to generate a slide deck that has two slides for each variable, along with a first introductory
slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be able to take it from there. Add more slides at the beginning as necessary,
add more slides after looping over the variables, add more slides into the child document,
make a fancier loop, or anything. Once you have the building blocks, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of
arranging them appropriately. My hope is that this little demo gave you another building block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other aspects I&amp;rsquo;d like to demonstrate are: Two-column slides; and conditional logic for
dynamically generating the output comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-column-slides&#34;&gt;Two-column slides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty easy. As I noted above, the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/powerpoint-presentation.html&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt; book has examples.
The basic idea is that you have a set of colons (:) to denote the start and end of column sets,
and a (smaller) set of colons to denote the start and end of columns, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=&amp;quot;40%&amp;quot;}
Content of the left column.
:::

::: {.column width=&amp;quot;60%&amp;quot;}
Content of the right column.
:::
::::::
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for instance, we might replace the &lt;code&gt;table-slide&lt;/code&gt; with the following, we get a two-column slide.
Note that the column notation goes &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the chunk, or put another way, the code chunk goes
inside a particular column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r, results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;}
cat(&amp;quot;# Two-column Slide: &amp;quot;, param_ii_nice, &amp;quot; | Statistics&amp;quot; )
```

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=&amp;quot;40%&amp;quot;}
```{r, ft.left=1, ft.top=2 }
iris %&amp;gt;%
  group_by( Species ) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(
    Mean = round( mean( get(param_ii) ), 2 ),
    SD   = round( sd( get(param_ii) ), 3 ),
    N    = n()
  ) %&amp;gt;%
  flextable() %&amp;gt;% theme_zebra() %&amp;gt;% autofit()
```

::: {.column width=&amp;quot;60%&amp;quot;}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can put several tables in a single column, using multiple code chunks, so that you can set
&lt;code&gt;ft.left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ft.top&lt;/code&gt; for each table. I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate that in the last section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditional-logic-for-results&#34;&gt;Conditional logic for results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the placeholder text for the table slide, I mentioned that you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to use
conditional logic for the results, otherwise every iteration of the child slide will have
exactly the same text. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we need to run an ANOVA on each outcome. Yes, there are issues
with this, one of which is that you&amp;rsquo;d need to be paying attention to how many comparisons you&amp;rsquo;re
making, and adjust p-values appropriately. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to worry about that for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a bit of formatting to the tables. One thing I did was define a
border. To reduce typing, I add the command &lt;code&gt;h1 &amp;lt;- officer::fp_border( width=0.75 )&lt;/code&gt;
to the setup chunk of my document. Often I define several lines of varying width
and style (e.g., a dashed line). This way I can use them in any table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r, results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;}
cat(&amp;quot;# ANOVA: &amp;quot;, param_ii_nice, &amp;quot;&amp;quot; )
```

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you to inspect the logic creating the sentences. The basic idea is to create a
string which has Markdown syntax and then print it using the chunk option &lt;code&gt;results=&amp;quot;asis&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. You
can get fancier, like incorporating the p-values or other results, and so on. But again, my point
here is to provide a building block so that you can use it to do things that I haven&amp;rsquo;t even thought about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about this is that the iris dataset happens to show a difference in mean between all
species and for all variables. If you want to see the logic changing the slides, either use a different
dataset (you&amp;rsquo;ll naturally need to change the analysis codes!), or when you load the data, make some
modification so that the means won&amp;rsquo;t differ. For example, you can permute one variable with the line:
&lt;code&gt;iris[[&amp;quot;Sepal.Length&amp;quot;]] &amp;lt;- sample( iris[[&amp;quot;Sepal.Length&amp;quot;]] )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s it for this post. I hope it will give you a nice little trick to put in your back pocket
for use in some project in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
