# Biography

Iâ€™m a Statistician currently working as part of a statistics group at Sandia National Laboratories. 

My PhD advisor was 
[Rajib Paul](https://ech.charlotte.edu/directory/rajib-paul/) (now at UNC-Charlotte), 
who introduced me to spatial statistics for large datasets. We focused on developing methods for 
cases when normality was not a suitable assumption.

After finishing my PhD [Shyamal Peddada](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bcb/staff/peddada) 
offered me a postdoctoral research position at the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. We worked on some spatial methods, 
but he also introduced me to the area of order-restricted inference. With him I wrote the R package 
[CLME](https://github.com/jelsema/CLME), which implements a constrained linear mixed effects model 
using nonparametric bootstrap for inference.

Since joining Sandia my research efforts have been drawn to what is needed for the problems at hand. 
This has brought me to investigate methods for reliability. I've also started dabbling with robust 
nonparametric methods once again.

Eventually this website will provide some links to R packages, research papers, or some other miscellaneous thoughts I feel like writing a bit about.
