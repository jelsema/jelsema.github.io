      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome! If you&amp;rsquo;ve found your way to this page &amp;hellip; well, I&amp;rsquo;m more than a little surprised. This is my personal website. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing here. My plan at the moment is to use it mainly for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listing professional things like publications independently of my place of employment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host the slides for talks or workshops that I give.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have some posts (is that &amp;lsquo;blogging&amp;rsquo;? Save me!) about topics that pique my interest. This would likely be my thoughts on some bit of Statistics or science that came across my screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about science and statistics in the context of COVID-19 on social media for a while now. I may transition some of that here, since social media isn&amp;rsquo;t usually conducive to the long-form comments I make often enough.&lt;/p&gt;
