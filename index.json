A classic example occurs in linear regression models under multicollinearity but there are many more such examples. There is well-developed theory for testing linear equality constraints when the alternative is two-sided and the variance matrix is either singular or nonsingular. In recent years, there is considerable, and growing, interest in developing methods for situations in which the estimated variance matrix is nearly singular. However, there is no corresponding methodology for addressing one-sided, that is, constrained or ordered alternatives. In this article, we develop a unified framework for analyzing such problems. Our approach may be viewed as the trimming or winsorizing of the eigenvalues of the corresponding variance matrix. The proposed methodology is applicable to a wide range of scientific problems and to a variety of statistical models in which inequality constraints arise. We illustrate the methodology using data from a gene expression microarray experiment obtained from the NIEHS’ Fibroid Growth Study.

On the Mongolian Plateau, a recent decade-long drought that exceeded the variability in the instrumental record was associated with economic, social, and environmental change. We evaluate this drought using an annual reconstruction of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) spanning the last 2060 years in concert with simulations of past and future drought through the year 2100 CE. We show that although the most recent drought and pluvial were highly unusual in the last 2000 years, exceeding the 900-year return interval in both cases, these events were not unprecedented in the 2060-year reconstruction, and events of similar duration and severity occur in paleoclimate, historical, and future climate simulations. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) ensemble suggests a drying trend until at least the middle of the 21st century, when this trend reverses as a consequence of elevated precipitation. Although the potential direct effects of elevated CO2 on plant water use efficiency exacerbate uncertainties about future hydroclimate trends, these results suggest that future drought projections for Mongolia are unlikely to exceed those of the last two millennia, despite projected warming.","tags":["copula","geography","drought","mongolia"],"title":"Past and future drought in Mongolia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Law","Keith Morris","Casey Jelsema"],"categories":["publication","methods"],"content":"","date":1493769600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493769600,"objectID":"6160d3ede8397d566b4b0f1ba430cd2f","permalink":"/publication/2017-test-fire1/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-test-fire1/","section":"publication","summary":"Many studies have been performed in recent years in the field of firearm examination with the goal of providing an objective method for comparisons of fired cartridge cases. No published research to support the number of test fires needed to represent the variability present within the impressions left on a cartridge case could be found. When a suspect firearm is submitted to a firearm examiner, typically two to four test fires are performed. The recovered cartridge cases are compared to each other to determine which characteristics from the firearm are reproducing, and then compared to any cartridge cases collected at a crime scene. The aim of this research was to determine the number of test fires examiners should perform when a suspect firearm is submitted to the lab to balance cartridge case acquisition time with performance accuracy. Each firearm in the IBIS® database at West Virginia University® is represented by approximately 100 fired cartridge case entries. Random samples of cartridge cases were taken separately from the breech face match score and firing pin match score lists. This subset was compared to the total match distribution of the firearm using a hybrid equivalence test to determine if the subset of similarity scores were statistically equivalent to the larger distribution of scores. For the sampled distribution to remain above 80% equivalent to the match distribution, a minimum of 15 cartridge cases should be used to model the match distribution, based on IBIS® scores. Thirty cartridge cases is a conservative estimate, allowing one to determine that the location and dispersion of the match and sampling distributions are equivalent with nearly 100% probability.","tags":["monte carlo","equivalence testing","forensics","test fires"],"title":"Determining the number of test fires needed to represent the variability present within 9mm Luger firearms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Casey Jelsema","Shyamal Peddada"],"categories":["publication","methods"],"content":"","date":1479513600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479513600,"objectID":"b39d1577f8cf960898d166be326f8ad4","permalink":"/publication/2016-clme/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-clme/","section":"publication","summary":"In many applications researchers are typically interested in testing for inequality constraints in the context of linear fixed effects and mixed effects models.

Millions of dollars have been spent to try to ameliorate this damaging process using anti-oxidant therapies. Currently, the best accepted biomarker of oxidative stress is the lipid oxidation product 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), which has been measured in over a thousand human and animal studies. 8-iso-PGF2α generation has been exclusively attributed to nonenzymatic chemical lipid peroxidation (CLP). However, 8-iso-PGF2α can also be produced enzymatically by prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases (PGHS) in vivo. When failing to account for PGHS-dependent generation, 8-iso-PGF2α cannot be interpreted as a selective biomarker of oxidative stress. We investigated the formation of 8-iso-PGF2α in rats exposed to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using the 8-iso-PGF2α/PGF2α ratio to quantitatively determine the source(s) of 8-iso-PGF2α. Upon exposure to a 120mg/kg dose of CCl4, the contribution of CLP accounted for only 55.6±19.4% of measured 8-iso-PGF2α, whereas in the 1200mg/kg dose, CLP was the predominant source of 8-iso-PGF2α (86.6±8.0% of total). In contrast to CCl4, exposure to 0.5mg/kg LPS was characterized by a significant increase in both the contribution of PGHS (59.5±7.0) and CLP (40.5±14.0%). In conclusion, significant generation of 8-iso-PGF2α occurs through enzymatic as well as chemical lipid peroxidation. The distribution of the contribution is dependent on the exposure agent as well as the dose. The 8-iso-PGF2α/PGF2α ratio accurately determines the source of 8-iso-PGF2α and provides an absolute measure of oxidative stress in vivo.","tags":["order restricted inference","bootstrap"],"title":"Reinterpreting the best biomarker of oxidative stress: The 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α/prostaglandin F2α ratio shows complex origins of lipid peroxidation biomarkers in animal models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajib Paul","Casey Jelsema","Rex Lau"],"categories":["publication","methods"],"content":"","date":1432166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1432166400,"objectID":"ad6c9f50ae37a69c5c44e910231fbc56","permalink":"/publication/2015-frssm/","publishdate":"2019-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-frssm/","section":"publication","summary":"In environmental studies, the datasets exhibiting non-Gaussian properties, such as heavier or lighter tails and multimodality, are very common.

The spatial model provides the flexibility to deal with such properties through scale mixtures of Gaussian distributions and a two-level marginally noninformative inverse-Wishart prior. A general framework for posterior summaries based on Markov Chain Central Limit Theorem (MCCLT) has been developed and conditions of MCCLT on ergodic averages are theoretically verified. The Monte Carlo standard errors based on MCCLT are computed using batch-mean method.

We use log-normal kriging for the components of compositional data, and show how to obtain estimates and measures of precision in isometric log-ratio coordinates.","tags":["spatial"],"title":"Lognormal block kriging with applications to goal geology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience / Contact","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience / Contact","type":"widget_page"}]
